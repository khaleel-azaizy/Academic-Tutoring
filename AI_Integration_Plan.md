- **Pronunciation Help** - For language learning
- **Audio Summaries** - Convert text to speech

### Visual Features:
- **Handwriting Recognition** - Scan and analyze handwritten work
- **Math Problem Scanner** - Photo-to-solution for math problems
- **Document Analysis** - Extract key points from textbooks

## Implementation Approach:

### Option 1: OpenAI GPT-4 (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Most advanced language model
- Great for educational content
- Extensive documentation
- Multiple model options (GPT-3.5 cheaper, GPT-4 more capable)

**Cons:**
- Can be expensive with high usage
- Requires API key management

**Cost:** ~$0.01-0.03 per 1K tokens (very affordable for tutoring use)

### Option 2: Open Source Alternatives
**Options:**
- **Ollama** (Run models locally)
- **Hugging Face Models**
- **LLaMA 2** (Meta's open model)

**Pros:**
- No API costs after setup
- Complete control over data
- Can run offline

**Cons:**
- Requires more technical setup
- Need powerful hardware
- Less sophisticated than GPT-4

## Recommended Starting Point:

### 1. AI Chat Assistant
- Simple chat interface for students
- Subject-specific prompts
- Safe, educational responses only

### 2. Smart Study Helper
- Generate study materials
- Create practice questions
- Explain difficult concepts

### 3. Teacher Dashboard AI
- Analyze student questions
- Suggest teaching improvements
- Generate reports

## Technical Implementation:

I can help you implement:
1. **Backend AI API routes**
2. **Frontend chat interface**
3. **AI service integration**
4. **Safety filters for educational content**
5. **Usage tracking and cost management**

Would you like me to start with a specific AI feature? I recommend beginning with the **AI Tutor Assistant** as it provides immediate value to students and is relatively simple to implement.

## Budget Considerations:

### OpenAI Pricing (Approximate):
- **GPT-3.5-turbo:** $0.001/1K tokens (very cheap)
- **GPT-4:** $0.03/1K tokens (more expensive but better)
- **For 1000 student questions/month:** ~$10-50 depending on model

### Free Alternatives:
- **Hugging Face:** Free tier available
- **Ollama:** Completely free (self-hosted)
- **Google Colab:** Free GPU for model testing
